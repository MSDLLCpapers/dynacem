## Convenience function to calculate 'future' cost-effectiveness results
## ========================================================================

#' Calculate present value for a payoff in a single cohort with dynamic pricing across multiple timepoints
#' 
#' Present value of a series of payoffs for a single given cohort, entering at given future time, allowing for dynamic pricing. This function is a wrapper for [dynpv()].
#' @inheritParams dynpv
#' @param l Vector of times at which present value is to be evaluated
#' @seealso [dynpv()]
#' @returns Discounted present value
#' @export
#' @examples
#' # Obtain dataset
#' democe <- get_dynfields(
#'    heemodel = oncpsm,
#'    payoffs = c("cost_daq_new", "cost_total", "qaly"),
#'    discount = "disc"
#'    )
#' 
#' # Obtain discount rate
#' discrate <- get_param_value(oncpsm, "disc")
#' 
#' # Obtain payoff vector of interest
#' payoffs <- democe |>
#'    dplyr::filter(int=="new") |>
#'    dplyr::mutate(cost_oth = cost_total - cost_daq_new)
#' Nt <- nrow(payoffs)

#' # Run calculation for timesteps 1:10
