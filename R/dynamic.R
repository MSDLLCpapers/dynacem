## Collection of functions to calculate cost-effectiveness model results
## with dynamic pricing and uptake
## =====================================================================

#' Trim the tailing zeroes from a long vector
#'
#' @param vec Vector. Final elements may be zero.
#' @returns A vector whose length is shorter than the original, if there were trailing zero elements
#' @export
#' @examples
#' trim_vec(c(1:10, rep(0,3)))
trim_vec <- function(vec){
  # Identify the last element before vector elements are zero
  trimto <- which(rev(cumsum(rev(vec)))==vec)[1]
  # Return trimmed vector
  return(vec[1:trimto])
}

#' Calculate present value for a payoff with dynamic pricing and dynamic uptake
#' 
#' Present value of a payoff affected by dynamic pricing, with uptake across multiple cohorts (dynamic uptake)
#' @param uptakes Vector of patient uptake over time
#' @param horizon Time horizon for the calculation (length must be less than or equal to the length of payoffs)
#' @param tzero Time at the date of calculation, to be used in lookup in prices vector
#' @param payoffs Vector of payoffs of interest (numeric vector) 
#' @param prices Vector of price indices through the time horizon of interest
#' @param discrate Discount rate per timestep, corresponding to price index
#' @returns Two lists named `inputs` and `results`.
#' The `inputs` list contains a list of the following parameters called with the function: `uptakes, payoffs, horizon, tzero, prices`, and `discrate`. 
#' The `results` list contains the following elements:
#' - `ncoh`: Number of cohorts of uptaking patients
#' - `uptake`: Total number of uptaking patients
#' - `calc`: Tibble of calculation results
#' - `cohpv`: Tibble of summarized calculation results for each uptake cohort
#' - `total`: Total present value
#' - `mean`: Average present value per uptaking patient (=total/uptake)
