The goal of *dynacem* is to evaluates cost-effectiveness models with dynamic pricing and uptake.

Cost-effectiveness models are conventionally developed for single cohorts without considering of lifecycle drug pricing or other causes of dynamic pricing. This package allows calculation of cost-effectiveness results after applying dynamic pricing and dynamic uptake assumptions. The starting point is a conventional cohort cost-effectiveness model, such as one computed using the [heemod](https://cran.r-project.org/package=heemod) package.

## Installation

You can install the development version of dynacem from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r install}
# install.packages("pak")
# pak::pak("MSDLLCpapers/dynacem")
```

## Example

Some example present value calculations are provided below for a single payoff. A typical cost-effectiveness model may involve several separate payoffs, for each intevention modeled, each with their own price index and discount rate.

```{r getdata}
# Load the dynacem package
library(dynacem)
library(ggplot2)

# Review oncpsm model (heemod object)
oncpsm

# Derive the dataset necessary for the dynamic pricing/uptake calculations
democe <- get_dynfields(
    heemodel = oncpsm,
    payoffs = c("cost_daq_new", "cost_total", "qaly"),
    discount = "disc"
    )
head(democe)

# Obtain a vector of payoffs
payoffs <- democe |>
    dplyr::filter(int=="new") |>
    dplyr::mutate(cost_oth = cost_total - cost_daq_new)
payoffs
```

Now let us calculate a discounted present value, given dynamic uptake (of one patient per timestep) and dynamic pricing. We assume that there are 52 timesteps per year and a discount rate of 3% (real) per year. The general rate of inflation is 5% per year. The underlying price of the payoff being costed rises with inflation of 5% for the first three years, then drops by 50%, where it rises by 4% per year.

```{r calc1}
# Time horizon
Nt <- nrow(payoffs)

# Nominal discount rate
disc_py <- 0.03 + 0.05
disc_pt <- (1+disc_py)^(1/52) - 1

# Price index
prices <- c(1.05^((1:156)/52), 0.5 * (1.05^3) * 1.04^((1:(2 * Nt-156))/52))

# Graphically check the prices index
dsprices <- tibble::tibble(
  years = (1:Nt)/52,
  prices = prices[1:Nt]
)
ggplot2::ggplot(dsprices, aes(x = years, y = prices)) +
  geom_line()

# Calculate total discounted present value, given dynamic uptake and pricing
pv1 <- dynpv(
    uptakes = rep(1, Nt),
    payoffs = payoffs$cost_oth,
    prices = prices[1:Nt],
    disc = disc_pt
    )
pv1$results
```

We also wish to calculate discounted present values into the future, say every annually for 10 years. We need a price index that lasts 30 years (20 year time horizon + up to 10 years of future evaluations). We would expect this to change over time due to the price index.

```{r calc2}
# Present value at time 1, 53, 105, ...
pv2 <- futurepv(
  l = (1:10)*52 - 51,
  payoffs = payoffs$cost_oth,
  prices = prices,
  disc = disc_pt
)
pv2$results
```
