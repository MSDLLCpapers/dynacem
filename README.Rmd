The goal of *dynacem* is to evaluates cost-effectiveness models with dynamic pricing and uptake.

Cost-effectiveness models are conventionally developed for single cohorts without considering of lifecycle drug pricing or other causes of dynamic pricing. This package allows calculation of cost-effectiveness results after applying dynamic pricing and dynamic uptake assumptions. The starting point is a conventional cohort cost-effectiveness model, such as one computed using the [heemod](https://cran.r-project.org/package=heemod) package.

## Installation

You can install the development version of dynacem from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r install}
#| eval: false
install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("MSDLLCpapers/dynacem")
```

## Example

Some example present value calculations are provided below for a single payoff. A typical cost-effectiveness model may involve several separate payoffs, for each intevention modeled, each with their own price index and discount rate.

### Obtain payoffs vector

In this case, we call out the drug acquisition cost of the new intervention (*cost_daq_new*), the total cost (*cost_total*) and QALYs (*qaly*) accumulated in each timestep. The *get_dynfields()* function will also calculated 'rolled-up' values as at the start of each timestep rather than discounted to time zero.

```{r getdata}
# Load the dynacem package
library(dynacem)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)

# Review oncpsm model (heemod object)
oncpsm

# Derive the dataset necessary for the dynamic pricing/uptake calculations
democe <- get_dynfields(
    heemodel = oncpsm,
    payoffs = c("cost_daq_new", "cost_total", "qaly"),
    discount = "disc"
    )
head(democe)
```

For this example, we are just interested in the payoff for drug acquisition costs of the new intervention.

```{r payoffs}
# Obtain a vector of payoffs
payoffs <- democe |>
    dplyr::filter(int=="new") |>
    dplyr::select(model_time, int, cost_daq_new, cost_daq_new_rup)
payoffs
```

### Define dynamic pricing and uptake

Now let us calculate a discounted present value, given dynamic uptake of one patient per timestep, and dynamic pricing.

- We assume that there are 52 timesteps per year and a discount rate of 3% (real) per year.
- The general rate of inflation is 5% per year.
- The underlying price of the payoff being costed rises with inflation of 5% for the first three years, then drops by 50%, after which it rises by 4% per year.

We create a price index twice as long as we need right now for reasons that should become clear later.

```{r calc1}
# Time horizon
Nt <- nrow(payoffs)

# Nominal discount rate
disc_py <- 0.03 + 0.05
disc_pt <- (1+disc_py)^(1/52) - 1

# Price index
prices <- c(1.05^((1:156)/52), 0.5 * (1.05^3) * 1.04^((1:(2 * Nt-156))/52))

# Graphically check the prices index
tibble::tibble(
  years = (1:Nt)/52,
  prices = prices[1:Nt]
  ) |>
  ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = years, y = prices)) +
    ggplot2::geom_line() +
    ylim(0, 1.5)
```

### Calculate current present value

Now with the payoff, uptake, pricing and discount rate set, we can call the *dynpv()* function and calculate the present value of the payoff.

```{r calc_pv}
# Calculate total discounted present value of drug acquisition costs, given dynamic uptake and pricing
pv1 <- dynpv(
    uptakes = rep(1, Nt),
    payoffs = payoffs$cost_daq_new_rup,
    prices = prices[1:Nt],
    disc = disc_pt
    )
pv1$results
```

### Present values into the future

We also wish to calculate discounted present values (PV) into the future, say every annually for 10 years.

We need a price index that lasts 30 years (20 year time horizon + up to 10 years of future evaluations). Fortunately our price index is 40 years long (2 x 20).

We would expect the PV to change over time. The nominal PV will increase over time due to price inflation of of this payoff of 4\% per year. The real PV will decrease because the rate of price inflation of this particular payoff (4\% per year) is less than the general rate of inflation (5\% per year) factored into the nominal discount rate (8\% per year).

```{r calc2}
# Present value at time 1, 53, 105, ...
pv2 <- futurepv(
  l = (1:11)*52 - 51,
  payoffs = payoffs$cost_daq_new_rup,
  prices = prices,
  disc = disc_pt
)

# Obtain a dataset of the real and nominal ICER over time
ds <- pv2$results$mean |>
  dplyr::rename(Nominal = mean) |>
  dplyr::mutate(
    Years = tzero/52,
    pinfl = 1.05^Years,
    Real = Nominal / pinfl
    ) |>
  tidyr::pivot_longer(
    cols = c("Nominal", "Real"),
    names_to = "Type",
    values_to = "PV"
  )

# Plot real and nominal ICER over time
ggplot2::ggplot(ds,
  aes(x = Years, y = PV, color=Type)) +
  ggplot2::geom_line() +
  xlim(0, 10) +
  ylim(0, 150000)
```
